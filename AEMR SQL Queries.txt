/* AEMR stands for American Energy Market Regulator, and is responsible for ensuring Americaâ€™s energy network is reliable and has minimal outages. I wrote these queries
to focus on energy stability, market outages, energy losses, and market reliability. The data from these queries was used to develop my Tableau presentation: AEMR Case Study.
You can view my AEMR Case Study visualization in my Tableau public profile. */
