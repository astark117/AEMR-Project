# AEMR Project
 
AEMR stands for American Energy Market Regulator and they are responsible for ensuring 
America's electrical grid is reliable with minimal outages.

AEMR saw outages rise over 2016 and 2017 and have two areas of concern:
1) Energy Stability and Market Outages
2) Energy Losses and Market Reliability

The AEMR SQL Queries text file is full of queries I wrote to gather
data from AEMR's outages database. 

This data was used to create a Tableau visualization to present to stakeholders, which
you can view in my Tableau public portfolio.
