# SQL_Queries
 
Here is where I will be posting SQL queries I have written.

The AEMR SQL Queries text file is full of queries I wrote to gather
data from an energy company's outages database. This data will be used
to create a Tableau visualization to present to stakeholders, which
you can view in my Tableau public portfolio.

I will update the readme as I add more to this repository.
